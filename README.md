### Cloud Computing?
A.  _The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather a local server or personal computer._

Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to

* **compute power** meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
* **storage** like files and/or databases
* **networking** in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
* **analytics** services for visualization and telemetry data


**Benefits of Cloud Computing**
1. Cost effective
2. Global
3. Secure
4. Reliable
5. Scalable
6. Elastic
7. Current

- **scalability** is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
- **elasticity** is the ability to scale dynamically
- **agility** is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
- **fault tolerance** is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
- **disaster recovery** is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
- **high availability** is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
 **availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)**

### Economies of Scale<br>
The principle of economies of scale states that as the companies grow they become more effective at managing shared operations. Be that HR and hiring, taxes, accounting, internal operations, marketing, big purchases via contracts meaning better discounts, etc. etc.

Because of those, companies can save/earn more which in return allows for reduction in cost of their services to their customers. This is so called ‘price per unit’.

It’s not possible to go to 0 because in the end some underlying infrastructure needs to run to provide the services. But the larger the scale the more benefits can be passed to customers.

In fact, in the current scale, Microsoft can already offer multiple services for free due to how small a fraction of the cost it is for them.

### CapEx vs OpEx
Differences between Capital Expenditure and Operational Expenditure

|                  |   Capital Expenditure      |    Operational Expenditure     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Up front cost    |        Significant         |             None               |
| Ongoing cost     |            Low             |           Based on usage       |
| Tax Deduction	   |         Over time	        |            Same year           |
|Early Termination |	          No	        |             Anytime            |
|Maintenance	   |          Significant	|               Low              |
|Value over time   |            Lowers	        |             No change          |

<hr>

### What is a consumption-based model?<br>
The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud so that customers are only charged based on their resource usage.

This model is characterized by-

* **No associated upfront cost**
* **No wasted resources as such no charges are incurred for unused resources**. Unused in this case is different per service. For instance, blob storage that stores any data is considered to be used, as it consumes the storage space. Virtual Machines that are running consume CPU, memory and other resources even if there isn’t any traffic. Hence they are considered to be used and will incur charges.
* **Pay for what you need**
* **Stop paying when you don’t**

Consumption is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used. Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer best possible pricing model. Those metrics are tracked on very granular level.

<hr>

### Service Models responsibilities<br>
As a service means which party will manage the particular layer and all the layers below.

* **Software layer** consists the application (application code and set) & the application data
* **Platform layer** means all the supporting software and the operating system required to host the application
* **Infrastructure layer** consists hardware the infrastructure and virtualization required to host the platform

|      Layer	   |     Layer     |

### Total Cost of Ownership


### Consumption based model
This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

* No upfront costs.
* No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
* The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
* The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

### Compare cloud pricing models
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
* Plan and manage your operating costs.
* Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
* Scale as your business needs change.

To put it another way, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter. You can treat cloud resources like you would resources in your own datacenter. However, unlike in your own datacenter, when you're done using cloud resources, you give them back. You’re billed only for what you use.

Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them. The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you. The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.

<hr>

### Cloud Architecture Terminologies
* Availability - Your ability to ensure service remains available **Highly Available (HA)**
* Scalability - Your ability to grow rapidly or unimpeded
* Elasticity - Your ability to shrinnk and grow to meet the demand
* Fault Tolerance - Your ability to prevent a failure
* Disaster Recovery - Your ability to recover from a failure **Highly Durable (HD)**
* Agility

#### High Availability -
Multiple Datacenters and multiple servers<br>
 **Azure Load Balancer**<br>
  A load balancer would evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or more datacenters and if a datacenter or server becomes unavailable (unhealthy), it will route to only available datacenters with servers to ensure availability.

#### High Scalability -
1. Vertical Scaling - (Scaling Up) Upgrade to a bigger server.
2. Horizontal Scaling - (Scaling Out) Add more servers of the same size.

#### High Elasticity -
Automatically adding or removing servers to increase or decrease capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory and computing power.<br>
_Horizontal Scaling_ <br>
- Scaling Out- Add more servers of the same size<br>
-  Scaling In- Remove more servers of the same size<br>
 **Azure VM Scale Sets**<br>
Automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.
**SQL Server Stretch Database**<br>

#### High Durability -

### Evolution of Computing
*Dedicated* =><br>
              **_Cons_**<br>
              Wholly utilized by a single customer<br>
              **_Pros_**<br>
              Guarantee of security, privacy and full utility of underlying resources<br>
              
*VMs* => mutliple virtual machines on one machine through - Hypervisor<br>
         **_Cons_**<br>
         Multiple apps on a single virtual machine can result in conflicts in resource sharing.<br>
         
*Containers* =>  Virtual machines running on multiple containers using Docker Daemon<br>
                 **_Pros_**<br>
                 Maximum utilization of the available capacity so cost-effective<br>
                 Containers are more efficient than multiple VMs, as they share the same underlying OS<br>
                 Multiple apps can run side by side and will not cause conflicts in resource sharing<br>
              
*Functions* => A managed VM running managed containers, known as Serverless Compute<br>
               **_Pros_**<br>
               Ver cost-effective<br>
               **_Cons_**<br>
               Cold Starts are a side-effect of this setup<br>
           
<hr>

### Global Infrastructure - Regions and Geographies
A **region** is a grouping of multiple datacenters. (Availability zones)<br>
=> Azure has 58 regions available across 140 countries<br>

A **Geography** is discreet market of two or more regions that preserves **data residency** and **compliance boundaries** .<br>

**Paired Regions** => Each region is paired with another region 300 miles away.<br>

Only one region is updated at a time to ensure no outages.<br>

Some Azure services rely on Paired Regions for Disaster Recovery.<br>
**E.g. Azure Geo-redundant Storage (GRS)**

#### Region Types and Service Availability
1. Recommended Regions
2. Alternate (other) regions<br>

*General availability (GA)* is when a service is considered ready to be used publicly by everyone.<br>
Azure cloud services are grouped into three categories-
* Foundational - When GA immediately or in 12 months in Recommended or Alternate regions.
* Mainstream - When GA immediately or in 12 months in Recommended regions. May become available in Alternate region based on customer demand.
* Specialized - Available in Recommeded or Alternate region based on customer demand.

#### Special Regions
Azure has specialized regions to meet compliance or legal regions.

#### Availability Zones
An Availability Zone is physical location made up of one or more datacenter.
* A region will generally contain 3 availability zones.

#### AZ Supported Regions

#### Availability Sets Fault and Update Domains
An Availability Zone (AZ) in an Azure region is a combination of a fault domain and an update domain.<br>
**Fault Domain** - A logical grouping of hardware to avoid a single point of failure within an AZ. Group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch.<br>
**Update Domain** - Azure may need to apply updates to the underlying hardware and software. Update domains ensure your resources do not go offline.<br>
**Availability Set** - A logical grouping that you can use in Azure to ensure that the VMs you place in the Availability Set are different fault/update domains to avoid downtime.<br>
